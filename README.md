## Promt
`Build a dynamic text adventure game using Gemini and ImagenCreate a realistic medieval village environment, with a third-person player character exploring and fighting enemies in a dark, atmospheric souls-like style. The scene should include cobblestone streets, wooden houses with thatched roofs, medieval market stalls, torches illuminating the night, and a sense of mystery and danger. The player should be wearing rugged medieval armor, wielding a sword, and facing hostile enemies inspired by souls-like aesthetics â€” dark, intimidating, and challenging. The overall atmosphere should feel gritty, immersive, and cinematic.`
